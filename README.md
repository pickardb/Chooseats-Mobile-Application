# ChooseEats-App

> ChooseEats Mobile Application

## About

This project was originally created for the CPEN 321 course at UBC. 

ChooseEats was made to help groups of people decide where to eat. Using ChooseEats, you can create chat rooms, and invite all your friends using the room code. Once in a chat room, everyone can suggest restaurants and discuss, then vote on which restaurant is the best. If you don't feel like voting, you can allow the app to randomly choose for you!
